                    <p>The name 'Ichigoichie' (一期一会) is a Japanese concept that translates to "one time, one meeting" or "for this time only." It emphasizes the unique, unrepeatable nature of a moment. I chose this name because learning a language, especially
                        Japanese, is a personal journey filled with unique challenges, discoveries, and moments of understanding.</p>

                    <p>This mini-blog was born from my own experiences learning Japanese. I've always been fascinated by the language, partly due to enjoying Japanese media like manga, anime, and video games since I was young. However, my attempts to learn
                        were often met with frustration due to the language's complexity or a lack of clear progress. I also found that while the learning community is often enthusiastic and helpful, it can sometimes feel a bit overwhelming with too much
                        information or being too strict about "correct" learning methods, which can be discouraging for beginners.</p>

                    <p>So, this site is my response. My goal is not just to gather resources and avoid information overload, but also to honestly document my own learning path. I want to share the real challenges, like managing motivation, avoiding burnout,
                        building discipline, and adapting my studies to a busy schedule. The idea is to show how I'm moving from recurring frustration to steady, satisfying progress at a pace that works for me.</p>

                    <p><strong>The main objectives of this site are to:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Centralize learning resources:</strong> To collect and maintain a selection of useful resources (books, apps, websites, etc.) for studying Japanese, all in one place.</li>
                        <li><strong>Share a personal experience:</strong> To document my learning journey through blog posts (like journal entries, resource reviews, and reflections) to inspire and inform other learners.</li>
                        <li><strong>Offer a structured guide:</strong> To provide a "Roadmap" to help beginners and intermediate learners navigate the key stages of learning Japanese (Kana, Grammar, Vocabulary, Immersion).</li>
                        <li><strong>Visualize my personal progression:</strong> To use this site as a tool to track and see my own progress in learning Japanese.</li>
                        <li><strong>Engage with fellow learners:</strong> To offer simple interactive elements and interesting blog posts to encourage regular visits.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>This project is aimed at anyone learning Japanese, no matter their current level, who is looking for resources, advice, or motivation. The content will be in English to make it accessible to a broad international audience. It's especially
                        for those who appreciate personal experiences and a structured, yet flexible, approach to learning.</p>

                    <p>I hope that by sharing my journey, this site might help or inspire other learners facing similar difficulties.</p>

                        <p>こんにちは! I'm Rocco, the person behind this Japanese learning blog. I'm 27 years old, originally from Brazil, and currently living in Switzerland. I've always loved learning languages; Japanese is actually my fourth, after my native
                            Portuguese, English, and French. When I'm not wrestling with kanji or grammar, you can usually find me reading a good book, playing video games, or dreaming about cats (I really like cats!).</p>

                        <p>This blog is a way for me to share my journey as I dive deeper into Japanese. My big goal right now is to hopefully attend an intensive Japanese learning summer course in Japan during the summer of 2026. Until then, I'll be here,
                            learning and sharing. As a non-binary person, I'm also keen on creating a welcoming space for everyone interested in Japanese.</p>
